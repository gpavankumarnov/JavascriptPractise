//What is Git?
Git is a version control system. It tracks the latest commits, updates everything.


this is the file of git

//what are remote repo and local repo and working directory?
Remote repo - located online.
              
Local repo - located in your local machine.
           - copy of your remote repo.
           
Working Dir -  its a directory in your local machine.
            -  Copy of your all local repo files.
            
            
//What happens when i do "git add." and "commit" ?
       - git add . -> will add the changes made in the file to staging area(temporary area) to review & prepare the files before committing them into local repo.
       
       - git commit -> To permanently save the changes to the local repository, you will need to use the git commit command after adding the changes to the staging area.




//How to do commit?

//////////////I created this file before commit and here is the flow:
1. when you -> add . -> this adds the entire project files to the staged changes.
2. When you -> add <file> -> this adds only the changes you made in that file to staged changes.



//How to take pull?

//////////////To take a pull, use command -> git pull, this will do two actions.
2. git pull 
     - git fetches -> it will download all the changes from the remote repo to local repo.
     - git merges -> it will merge the remote repo to local repo.
        *Imp - make sure not to have any files unstaged in your local. if so git pull will overwrite all and replace them with remote files to local repo.

//merge conflict understanding from backend side whats running!
1. initially lets say :
                            - some developers pushed their changes on the file to github.
                            - And you didn't taken any latest pull of git remote repo.
                            - now as one of a developer, you have done the changes on the same file in your local repo.
                           Think from whats happening on the local repo.

                           so as i didn't take any latest pull and i am trying to add changes to the file and committing the changes - now my changes after committing will reflect and permanently save in the local repo.



//When will merge conflict comes into picture?
    - it comes when we have changes on the same file.
