//How to do commit?

//////////////I created this file before commit and here is the flow:
1. when you -> add . -> this adds the entire project files to the staged changes.
2. When you -> add <file> -> this adds only the changes you made in that file to staged changes.


//How to take pull?

//////////////To take a pull, use command -> git pull, this will do two actions.
2. git pull 
     - git fetches -> it will download all the changes from the remote repo to local repo.
     - git merges -> it will merge the remote repo to local repo.
        *Imp - make sure not to have any files unstaged in your local. if so git pull will overwrite all and replace them with remote files to local repo.
